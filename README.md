Railway Database Management System
Overview
The Railway Database Management System is a project designed to manage and store data related to a railway system. This system includes the creation of a structured database using SQL, handling data such as train schedules, stations, bookings, and more. The system is developed to demonstrate how database management can be applied to a real-world railway scenario.

Features
Train Information: Stores data related to trains, their schedules, and availability.

Station Management: Manages stations and their respective details such as location, facilities, etc.

Booking System: Facilitates the process of ticket booking, reservation, and tracking.
